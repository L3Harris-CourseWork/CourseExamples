# PHP Web Service

This is an example of a web service in PHP using JSON for communication.

## Running
Place the `web-service-client.html` and `web-service.php` in your `public_html`
directory and naviagate to `web-service-client.html` in a web browser.

## Description
This simple web service allows a user to submit two numbers (`num1` and `num2`)
in a JSON object and retreive the result.  The `web-service-client.html` page
has additional logic to demonstrate reading the result through a web page.
