<h1>API Project Examples</h1>
<p>This page contains several examples of APIs that you can utilize as a starting point for your rpoject.</p>


<ul>
	<li><b><a href="RandomClient.html">Random Number Example</a>: </b> Read a random value from an external source.</li>
	<li><b><a href="example-client.html">REST Basic Example</a>: </b> This basic example reads a local API file and produces output based on the user's actions.</li>

<!-- Add more examples as time allows -->
<!--
Candidate examples:
- Read input from an external JSON file (Just get the external information, do not parse it.)
- Parse an external JSON file
- Read an external weather application


	<li><b></b></li>
-->

</ul>

<!--
	- Perhaps have the instructor tell the students to create the input files as well

	-- For now, just focusing on documenting everything. Can always come back to the coding portion once everything is completed.
